    "\n",
    "### Problem Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Representation**:\n",
    "   Each digit is represented using a 7-segment display with binary encoding for segments `a-g`, as shown in the uploaded table. This will form the input layer of our network.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Output Representation**:\n",
    "   The network will have 10 output nodes (one for each digit, 0 to 9). Each node should output `1` if the corresponding digit is the input; otherwise, it should output `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Network Design**:\n",
    "   - **Input Layer**: 7 nodes (corresponding to segments `a` to `g` of the 7-segment display).\n",
    "   - **Hidden Layers**: Two hidden layers with adjustable numbers of neurons (we'll analyze the impact of this in point (i)).\n",
    "   - **Output Layer**: 10 nodes (one-hot encoding for digits 0 to 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activation Function**: Sigmoid function (non-linear) for each layer except the output layer. This will allow us to compute gradients smoothly.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), given by:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   MSE = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{10} (y_{ij} - \\hat{y}_{ij})^2\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   where $ y_{ij} $ is the true output (1 if the digit is $ i $, 0 otherwise) and $ \\hat{y}_{ij} $ is the predicted output for each of the 10 output neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - **Dataset Creation**: Use the 7-segment code table to create an input-output dataset. Each digit (0-9) will have a binary input vector of 7 segments and a one-hot encoded output vector of 10 values.\n",
    "   - **Training Data**: Since the patterns are fixed, we may create data pairs (input, output) for digits 0-9.\n",
    "   - **Data Augmentation** (if needed): Introduce slight noise to the 7-segment code for robustness (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Feedforward Pass**:\n",
    "     - Let $ x $ represent the input vector (binary vector of length 7).\n",
    "     - Let $ W^{(1)}, W^{(2)}, W^{(3)} $ represent the weight matrices between the input and first hidden layer, first and second hidden layer, and second hidden layer and output layer, respectively.\n",
    "     - **Hidden Layer 1**: Compute activations $ h^{(1)} = \\sigma(W^{(1)} x + b^{(1)}) $.\n",
    "     - **Hidden Layer 2**: Compute activations $ h^{(2)} = \\sigma(W^{(2)} h^{(1)} + b^{(2)}) $.\n",
    "     - **Output Layer**: Compute the output $ y = \\sigma(W^{(3)} h^{(2)} + b^{(3)}) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Backpropagation**:\n",
    "     - Compute the loss gradient with respect to the output layer weights, then propagate this gradient back through each layer.\n",
    "     - For each layer $ l $, compute:\n",
    "       $\n",
    "       \\delta^{(l)} = (y^{(l)} - \\hat{y}^{(l)}) \\odot \\sigma'(z^{(l)})\n",
    "       $\n",
    "       where $ \\delta $ represents the error term for layer $ l $, and $ z^{(l)} $ is the linear combination of inputs to layer $ l $.\n",
    "     - Update the weights using the gradients computed with respect to $ W^{(l)} $ for each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is the process used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. In this problem, we have a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers, a sigmoid activation function, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. I'll walk through each step of the backpropagation process mathematically.\n",

    "   - The output layer has 10 neurons (one for each digit, 0-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weight Matrices and Biases**:\n",
    "   - $ W^{(1)} $: Weight matrix between the input layer and the first hidden layer, of shape $ H_1 \\times 7 $.\n",
    "   - $ W^{(2)} $: Weight matrix between the first and second hidden layer, of shape $ H_2 \\times H_1 $.\n",

    "1. **Model Design**: A feedforward neural network with two hidden layers and sigmoid activation for each layer.\n",
    "2. **Training and Loss Calculation**: Using Mean Squared Error as the loss function.\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Possible adjustments include the number of neurons, batch size, and learning rate.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: 5-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure model stability and performance consistency.\n",
    "5. **Metrics and Convergence Analysis**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and plotting the convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code provides a full end-to-end approach for building a neural network to recognize alphabets based on a 5x5 grid representation. Adjust hyperparameters as needed for optimal performance."
